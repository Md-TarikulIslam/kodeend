Aggregating these scores, we determined the overall    sentiment polarity of each social media post. Furthermore, we employed clustering algorithms, such as K-means or DBSCAN, to group similar posts together and identify common sentiments    or topics.",

      "The clustered data was then analyzed to identify emerging trends, sentiment shifts, and  potential issues affecting the brand's reputation. By visualizing these insights, we provided our    client with a comprehensive overview of customer sentiment, allowing them to make data-driven    decisions and take proactive measures to address any concerns or capitalize on positive   feedback.",
