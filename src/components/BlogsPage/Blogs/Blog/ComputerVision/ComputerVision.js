              It is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers
              to analyze and comprehend visual input from their surroundings. It
              includes photographs, movies, and even 3D models. The objective of
              computer vision is to construct machines that can perceive and
              understand the environment in the same way that people do. This
              necessitates the use of complex algorithms, deep learning
              techniques, and powerful technology

              Computer vision works by processing visual input and disassembling
              it into its component pieces. This procedure consists of numerous
              steps:
            </Typography>
            <Typography className="text-left font-regular my-5">

                Picture Acquisition:
              </span>{" "}
              <br />
              Obtaining visual data is the initial stage in computer vision.
              This can be accomplished with the use of cameras, sensors, or
              other imaging equipment. <br /> <br />
              <span className="text-xl font-regular text-blue-700">
                Image Processing:
              </span>{" "}
              <br />
              When the data is collected, it is processed to eliminate noise and
              improve the image. Techniques such as filtering and picture
              segmentation can be applied. <br /> <br />
              <span className="text-xl font-regular text-blue-700">
                Extraction of Meaningful Features:
              </span>{" "}
              <br />
              The next stage is to extract significant features from the image,
              such as Identifying things, forms, colors, and textures etc. When
              the traits have been retrieved, the computer can recognize items
              and their connections to one another. Afterwards, The computer can
              utilize the information it has collected to make judgments and
              take action.
